*Caveat:* This website is being migrated from [nierstrasz.org](https://www.nierstrasz.org).
Not all content is available yet.

This web site contains mostly genealogical information about the Nierstrasz family, and various related families, including that of my wife, Angela Margiotta, and my paternal grandmother, Jet Hahn.

The information here has been cobbled together from various sources. (See the family tree for details.) I would be grateful for any additions, corrections or updates. (Emails in Dutch, German, Italian or French are also welcome!)
