”Nierstraß” is [a small town about 20 km. north of Aachen](https://goo.gl/maps/jtZpWQ1rht66TfQR6), Germany.

Note that the German “sharp S”, spelled “ß” is a [ligature for the characters “sz”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ß). Since this ligature was not used in Dutch, the name was written “Nierstrasz”. Nowadays in Germany it would be written “Nierstrass”, hence the alternative spelling on the map.

”Nierstrass” is a contraction of “Nieder Strasse”, which means “Nether Street” or “Low Street”. In fact, if you go there on foot from Geilenkirchen, you will follow a road that suddenly turns into a little gully with a cluster of houses. It is literally a “low road”!

The earliest known person who used “Nierstraß” as a family name was Leonard Nierstrasz, who was born some time before 1600 and died some time after 1650. He owned a dyeing works in Eschweiler (~ 10km east of Aachen) that he apparently inherited from his father-in-law. On 28 october 1619 he married in Eschweiler with Maria Fliegen von Eschweiler. In his marriage contract, Leonard's name is given as “Leonard Conen von Nerstradt”.

Leonard's great-great gandson, Johann Leonard (1734-1813) became a citizen of Maastricht in 1813, and his son Hendrik (1773-1855) was mayor of Maastricht from 1835-1850.
